# sms-shell
A shell written on python using the SMS Gateway API to send text messages from any unix machine. The idea behind it is that a UNIX machine can set a user's shell to this one, and the user may log in and check their cell phone's SMS messages without ever having to interact with the phone itself.

## Why this project has been orphaned

I don't trust the API that it's built on and will be creating a new one this summer (2018) so that I can continue to check my messsages via ssh.
